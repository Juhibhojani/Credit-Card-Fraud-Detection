# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Given Dataset consists of 284,807 credit card transactions with only 0.17% fraud data and hence a clear case of imbalanced dataset.

Dealing with imbalanced Dataset:
1) Undersampling 
2) Oversampling

Steps Followed during Data Anaylsis:
1) EDA
2) Data Visualization
3) Data Normalization
4) Dividing into Dependent and Independent Variables
5) Test - Train Split
6) Handling imbalanced dataset (Undersampling)
7) Handling imbalanced dataset (SMOTE) and Logistic Regression as Model
8) Result

Main disadvantage: Overfitting of model
Point to be noted: Not to use accuracy as metrics for determination of model's result
